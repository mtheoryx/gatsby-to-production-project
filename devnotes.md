# Keep track of what we are doing

## What will we use to build it?

- GatsbyJS
- Styled-Components
- Markdown
- Zeit static deploy

Later

API with Lambda/Gateway
Deployed with Terraform and AWS

## Topics

- Brand (fonts, icons, imagery and message)
- Communication mechanism (One-way, two-way, no-way)
- Audience (description of target audience)
- Passion (purpose why is this here)
- Time and limitations (schedules with posting, replies, streaming)
- Special Sauce (why you?)

### Brand

Domain(s) & DNS

Zeit
AWS Route 53
Namecheap

**Anything but Godaddy**

### Communication mechanism (One-way, two-way, no-way)


### Define and segment Audience

Peers (for fun)
Experts you follow (for extra level-up helps)
Want to get that next job (to hire me)
Want to level up at current job (for a promotion)
Customers/Clients to hire me for contract work

### Passion (launchpad)

What do you like to do
Who are you
How do I reach you

#### Professional Microsite (like a business card)

Short domain, succinct, not super personal

#### On-brand messaging (to flesh out)

Personal need not apply here

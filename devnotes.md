# Keep track of what we are doing

## Next up

- [ ] Docker and gatsbyV2 with a starter
- [ ] Dev server and hot reload working
- [ ] Styled-components
- [ ] Pages, linking, menu

### Project Direction

#### What will we use to build it

- [ ] GatsbyJS (docker, compose, maybe Vault)
- [ ] Styled-Components (grab a nerdy theme, for free!)
- [ ] Markdown (plugin)
- [ ] Zeit static deploy (script it)

Later (maybe..)

API with Lambda/Gateway, and S3 static bucket with https/dns and cloudfront
Deployed with Terraform and AWS

#### Topics

- Brand (fonts, icons, imagery and message)
- Communication mechanism (One-way, two-way, no-way)
- Audience (description of target audience)
- Passion (purpose why is this here)
- Time and limitations (schedules with posting, replies, streaming)
- Special Sauce (why you?)

#### Brand

Domain(s) & DNS

Zeit
AWS Route 53
Namecheap

Who to pick? **Anything but Godaddy**

#### Communication mechanism (One-way, two-way, no-way)

#### Define and segment Audience

Peers (for fun)
Experts you follow (for extra level-up helps)
Want to get that next job (to hire me)
Want to level up at current job (for a promotion)
Customers/Clients to hire me for contract work

#### Passion (launchpad)

What do you like to do
Who are you
How do I reach you

#### Professional Microsite (like a business card)

Short domain, succinct, not super personal

#### On-brand messaging (to flesh out)

Personal need not apply here (unless you want it to!)
